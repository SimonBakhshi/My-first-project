        <h1 id="secondHeader">Why Kylo Ben and Darth Walker fell in love</h1>
        <p>Darth Walker (born as Anakin Skywalker) is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise.
            He is a major antagonist in the original trilogy, but, as Skywalker, is one of the main protagonists of the prequel trilogy. 
            In the third film of the prequel trilogy, he becomes an <em>antagonist</em> (following his rebirth as Darth Vader) alongside <b>Palpatine</b>. 
            Star Wars creator George Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as <i>"the tragedy of Darth Vader"</i>.
            Originally a Jedi prophesied to bring balance to the Force, Anakin Skywalker is lured to the dark side of the Force by Palpatine, who manipulates his wavering faith towards the Jedi and his fear of losing his wife, <b>Padm√© Amidala</b>, and becomes a Sith Lord. 
            After fighting a lightsaber battle with his former mentor <b>Obi-Wan Kenobi</b> in which he is severely burnt and dismembered, Vader is transformed into a cyborg. He then serves the Galactic Empire as its chief enforcer until he ultimately redeems himself by saving his son, Luke Skywalker, and seemingly killing Palpatine, sacrificing his own life in the process.<sub>[2]</sub> <br />He is also the father of Princess Leia, and grandfather of Kylo Ren, a major antagonist of the sequel trilogy.
            The character has been portrayed by numerous actors, David Prowse physically portrayed Vader while James Earl Jones voiced him in the original trilogy, Sebastian Shaw portrayed the unmasked Vader in the sixth film as well as the character's force ghost in the original release of it. 
            Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen played the character in the prequel trilogy in the first and next two films respectively with Christensen also portraying the character's force ghost in the re-release of the sixth film in 2004. 
            His cinematic appearances span the first six Star Wars films, as well as Rogue One, and he is referenced in both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi and makes vocal cameos as both Vader and Anakin in The Rise of Skywalker. 
            He also appears in television series (most substantially The Clone Wars) and numerous iterations of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, including video games, novels, and comic books.
            Darth Walker has become one of the most iconic villains in popular culture, and has been listed among the greatest villains and fictional characters ever.<sub>[3][4]</sub> The American Film Institute listed him as the third greatest movie villain in cinema history on 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, behind Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates.
            <sub>[5]</sub> His role as a tragic hero in the saga was also met with positive reviews.<sub>[6][7]</sub> </p>
        <h1 id="thirdHeader">The deliberation of Darth Walker's sexual forces</h1>
            <p><b>Darth Vader</b> first appears in Star Wars <i>(later retitled A New Hope)</i> as a ruthless cyborg serving the Galactic Empire. 
            He is tasked, along with Grand Moff Tarkin, with recovering the secret plans for the Death Star superweapon, which were stolen by the Rebel Alliance. 
            Vader captures and tortures Princess Leia, who has hidden the plans inside the droid R2-D2 and sent it to find Vader's former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on the planet <i>Tatooine</i>. 
            During Leia's rescue by Obi-Wan's allies <b>Luke Skywalker</b> and Han Solo, Vader strikes down Obi-Wan in a lightsaber duel. Having placed a tracking device aboard their ship, the Millennium Falcon, Vader is able to track down the Rebel base on the planet Yavin 4.
            During the Rebel attack on the Death Star, boards his TIE fighter and attempts to shoot down Rebel X-wing fighters, but Solo intervenes and sends Vader's ship spiraling off course, allowing Luke to destroy the <i>Death Star</i>. </p>
